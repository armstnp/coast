# About

## Motivation

In my short web programming career, I've found two things
that I really like: Clojure and Ruby on Rails. This is my attempt
to put the two together in a tasteful, clojure-like way.

## Versioning

I also wanted to say more generally why I don't seem to make backwards compatible upgrades. Well, two reasons:

1. I'm usually working on new, backwards incompatible websites.
2. This is a web framework for indie hackers. The faster you can get to validation, the better.

So every new name (delta -> epsilon) for example is always a breaking change. If you're on the same name, it never has breaking changes. Keeps things pretty simple. If you aren't an [indie hacker](https://www.indiehackers.com) or if you've moved past the part where you're trying to throw stuff at the wall to see what sticks, this might not be the framework for you.
