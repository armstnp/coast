Open Source projects are maintained and backed by a **vibrant community** of developers and collaborators.

You can and should actively participate in the development and the future of Coast either by contributing to the source code, improving documentation, reporting potential bugs and/or testing new features.

## Channels

There are two ways to communicate with the Coast's small community

1. [Github Repos](https://github.com/coast-framework): Share bugs or create feature requests against the repos

2. [Twitter](https://twitter.com/coastonclojure): Stay in touch with the progress on the project every day and be informed about awesome projects built with coast

## Bug Reports

Any and all bug reports are welcome, there are no formatting requirements or requirements of any kind!

Bugs will hopefully be fixed as they come in, but usually get fixed in a week or so

PRs are also very welcome!

## Coding Style

Unfortunately, clojure doesnâ€™t have any official coding style yet so coast uses [this guide](http://tonsky.me/blog/clojurefmt/)

## Documentation

When adding a new feature to the core of the framework, be sure to create or add to one of the markdown doc files in `docs/`.

This will help everyone understand your feature and keep the documentation updated.

## Testing

Before providing a pull request be sure to test the feature you are adding or create a regression test to show how a piece of code fails under specific circumstance while providing a bug fix.
